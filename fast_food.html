    <h2>Fast Food Reccomendations</h2>
<h3>Mcdonalds:</h3>
Mcdonalds has a consumer rating of 2.49 stars from 220 reviews indicating that most customers are generally disatisfied with their purchase though I personally enjoy it. If you go there, I would reccomend that you get the nuggets as I believe that they are the best thing on the menu.

   <h3> Wendy's:</h3>
Wendys has a consumer rating of 2.59 stars from 37 reviews indicating that most customers are generally disatisfied with their purchase though I personally enjoy it. If you go there, I would reccomend that you get the four for four meal option as it provides good value for a great price.

   <h3> Chick Fil A:</h3>
    Chick Fil A has a consumer rating of 3.09 stars from 34 reviews indicating that most customers are generally satisfied with their purchase and I also enjoy it. If you go there, I would reccomend that you get one of the chicken sandwich deluxes as your meal with extra chickfila sauce.
