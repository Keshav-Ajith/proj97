    <h2>Cafe Reccomendations</h2>
<h3>StarBucks:</h3>
StarBucks has a consumer rating of 3.45 stars from 178 reviews indicating that most customers are generally satisfied with their purchase and I personally enjoy it. If you go there, I would reccomend that you get the mango dragonfruit lemonade as it is an exotic drink where I don tthink you can find somewhere else.

   <h3> Dunkin' Donuts:</h3>
Dunkin Donuts has a consumer rating of 2.57 stars from 67 reviews indicating that most customers are generally disatisfied with their purchase though I personally enjoy it. If you go there, I would reccomend that you get the iced chocolate as it is just a cold version of hot chocolate and it tastes great.
